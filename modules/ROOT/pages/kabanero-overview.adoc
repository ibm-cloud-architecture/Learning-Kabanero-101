Kabanero is designed to deliver an integrated workflow for application architects, application developers, and operations teams, allowing them to focus more intently in their respective area of expertise.

Kabanero workflows covers common scenarios for these different roles, such as architects defining base images and starter applications for developers, developers iterating through code changes from their favorite IDE without worrying about the setup of a Kubernetes cluster, and operation teams using pipelines that can continuously monitor code deliveries and deploy the finished applications to a running cluster.

The following sections outline the overall architecture of the system, its components, and explains the typical workflows for the different roles.

== Architecture

The Kabanero architecture supports the activity of application developers, application architects, and operations teams in continuously delivering applications to Kubernetes environments. The architecture also covers non-functional requirements, such as supporting the implementation of operational policies for application management and security.

The following figure illustrates the main building blocks of the architecture, which will be elaborated in the next sections.

== Kabanero Collections

A large portion of the Kabanero experience is centered around *Kabanero Collections*. A Kabanero Collection is created by an *application architect*, as a logical set of software components for developing and deploying applications. A collection is realized as components (such as tools and container images) used at coding time by application developers, and components forming a deployment pipeline that can extract, build, and deploy the resulting application image to a running Kubernetes cluster.

If necessary, a collection can be customized to meet local requirements. For example, you might want to define specific maintenance levels of software components or expose a particular port for your application. Customizing a collection provides a mechanism for controlling the precise development and runtime environment for an application. In a large organization, customization ensures that applications are developed and tested with a level of consistency that promotes quality and helps guarantee a seamless implementation in your production environment.

== Developer Experience

For *application developers*, the Kabanero experience is realized as tooling that allows a developer to continuously iterate over changes to source code and validate the changes, considerably reducing or even eliminating the amount of time spent setting up and dealing with infrastructure such as Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters. The current tooling is offered as a combination of the following initial offerings:

* https://appsody.dev[Appsody]: A Command-line interface with commands for creating, building, running, and deploying applications. Appsody also has extensions that are used by other portions of the architecture, in order to reassemble the application as a container image and to deploy it to a running container, and those will be covered in the respective sections of this overview.

* https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/[Codewind]: Hosted IDE (Codewind for Eclipse Che) and IDE extensions (Eclipse and Visual Studio Code) with a set of commands for creating, building, running, and profiling applications. When compared to Appsody, Codewind lacks the ability to deploy an application directly to a Kubernetes cluster, but it adds useful profiling capabilities where developers can inspect the usage of system resources between different local iterations on the source code.


== Architect Experience

The *solution architect* can codify technology standards and company policies using the Kabanero Management Experience. The architech defines **Collections** providing an efficient way for application developers to use them.
 

A *stack* is part of a Kabanero Collection and is the architectural component shared between application development and application deployment activities. A stack is realized as a container image designed, built, and published by an application architect, which can then be pulled into local registries by application developers and into the deployment pipeline upon code deliveries.

Although an *Appsody* stack is ultimately delivered as a regular container image, Kabanero specifies conventions for the internal structure of that image, with a clear separation between the portions of the stack that are common across all applications and the portions that are unique to each application, being visible and editable by application developers. 

Those conventions for a collection stack are detailed in the https://appsody.dev/docs/stacks/stack-structure[Stack Structure] section of the https://appsody.dev/[Appsody website]. For the cross-applications portion of the stack, an application architect makes choices such as the base container image, the runtime framework for the programming language being targeted by the collection, the toolset for the runtime framework, the management choices for the running application, and many other choices not directly related to the functional aspects of the application.

The stack structure also contains at least one application template: a set of source code files matching the technology of the stack. A template is used by the client portion of Kabanero upon request by application developers to create the first version of an application. As examples, a template may contain an empty website and web folder with all the visual branding elements for an organization, whereas another template may contain an empty REST-based application secured by API keys.

Kabanero provides initial collections for the most popular software development frameworks, but it is expected that feedback from developers, regular upgrades, and ever-evolving organizational requirements start to drive the creation of custom collections or the updating of existing ones.

== Operator Experience

Kabanero Foundation

The *Kabanero Foundation* sits on the opposite side of the developer experience, as a managed pipeline that handles the workflows after application developers deliver their source code to a remote repository. Kabanero Foundation is a set of Kubernetes components covering the disciplines of serving applications (https://knative.dev/[Knative]), service mesh (https://istio.io/[Istio]), build (https://cloud.google.com/tekton/[Tekton]), and deployment (https://github.com/operator-framework[Operator Framework]).

With these components deployed to a Kubernetes cluster, the Kabanero Foundation monitors changes to source code repositories (such as git) and triggers pipeline runs that will extract the source code, reassemble it according to the structure and runtime specifications of the underlying Kabanero Collection, execute all the build and verification steps, and then make the final application container pods available in the cluster.
