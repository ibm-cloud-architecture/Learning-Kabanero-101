= Appsody - Extending a Stack with Templates
:imagesdir: images
:toc:

== Prerequisites

* The following command line (CLI) tools and configured:
** https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[git]
** https://appsody.dev/docs/getting-started/installation[appsody]

== Getting Started

First we need to clone the stacks repository provided by appsody.

[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections.git
cd collections
git checkout v0.1.2
----

The Kabanero Collections repository provides us with all the stacks provided by Appsody as well as a sample stack in the `samples/sample-stack` directory.  The `sample stack` directory gives us the basic skeleton for starting a stack from scratch.

== Creating a New Stack Template

For this walkthrough however we are going to create a new stack template based on an existing template.  In this case we are going to modify the `nodejs-express` stack's `simple` template.  We are going to modify the `app.js` and the `README.md` files.

Let's start by navigating to the `nodejs-express simple template` directory.

[source, bash]
----
pushd incubator/nodejs-express/templates
----

Now we can copy the simple template into a new directory, to create a new template.

[source, bash]
----
cp -r simple/ simple-sample
cd simple-sample
----

Once in the simple-sample directory. Open the `simple-sample/app.js` file and add the following code to create a new endpoint for the application.

[source, node]
----
app.get('/test', (req, res) => {
  res.send("Testing a new Template in Appsody!!");
});
----

Save the file and now we need to create a `simple-sample/README` file.

[source, bash]
----
touch simple-sample/README.md
----

Next, add some content to `/simple-sample/README.md` file. Copy and paste the following into the `simple-sample/README.md`.

[source, markdown]
----
# Simple-Sample Template

This template uses Node.js with express.
----

Save the file and thats it for the changes for the template.

Return to the root of the project

[source, bash]
----
popd
----


== Building the Stack

Now it's time to add the new template into the stack. All we need to do is run the following command to start the package process. 

[source, bash]
----
STACKS_LIST=incubator/nodejs-express ./ci/package.sh
----

You should see at the end of the build process success messages
[source, bash]
----
Successfully built ccc85e795e33
Successfully tagged appsody/appsody-index:latest
Successfully tagged appsody/appsody-index:SNAPSHOT
created appsody/appsody-index:SNAPSHOT
----


== Adding the Repository to Appsody

Once the building of the new template is completed, we need to add the custom repository to appsody for it to run.

Add the repository to the list by runnning:

[source, bash]
----
appsody repo add custom-stack <URL to the Stack incubator-index-local.yaml>
----

Use the full qualified directory path to the file `incubator-index-local.yaml`
[source, bash]
----
appsody repo add custom-stack file://${PWD}/ci/assets/incubator-index-local.yaml
----

Verify that the new template `simple` for the stack `nodejs-express` using the repository `custom-stack` is available:

[source, bash]
----
appsody list custom-stack                                                       

REPO            ID              VERSION         TEMPLATES                               DESCRIPTION                      
custom-stack    nodejs-express  0.2.6           *simple, simple-sample, skaffold        Express web framework for Node.js
----

== Running the Application

To run the application we need to create a new directory and create a new appsody application inside it using the custom template.

[source, bash]
----
mkdir custom-nodejs
cd custom-nodejs
appsody init custom-stack/nodejs-express simple-sample
----

A new application is initialized into the new directory for you to be able to run.

Once the building is complete you can run the application with the following:

[source, bash]
----
appsody run
----

A new instance of the application will start in a docker container and you can see your updated applcation code by navigating to http://localhost:3000/test in your web browser

== Changing Package Versions

Now what if you want to use a different version of a Node.JS in your application.  This next guide will show you how quickly we can change the versions in your application and run them.

First we need to change the `dockerfile` for the `nodejs-express` image.
