== Getting Started

When using Tekton, building a pipeline will require code to be pulled from either a public or private repository. For security reasons an access token will need to be generated and configured on Tekton in order for it to pull any code from the repository.  In this guide we will create and configure s github token for a tekton pipeline to gain access to the repository to pull code.

== Generating the Token

First thing we need to do is generate the Github token.  Open Github.com and `login` with your username and password.

Once logged in, `Click` on your picture icon in the top left. Then go to `Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal Access Tokens`.

Here we want to generate a token, so `Click` on the `Generate a Token`. The token permissions need to be the `admin:repo_hook` which gives rad and write access to the repository hooks.

Once the token is created, make sure to copy it down for we will need it later.

== Tekton Dashboard

Now we need to gain access to your tekton dashboard running in Openshift.

Open up a Terminal window and login to Openshift.

Once logged in run the following commands to find the tekton dashboard URL.

[source, bash]
----
oc get route -n kabanero
----

From there, look for the name `tekton-dashboard`. It should look something like
