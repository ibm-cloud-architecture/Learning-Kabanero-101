== Getting Started

When using Tekton, building a pipeline will require code to be pulled from either a public or private repository. For security reasons an access token will need to be generated and configured on Tekton in order for it to pull any code from the repository.  In this guide we will create and configure a github token for a tekton pipeline to gain access to the repository to pull code.

== Generating the Token

First thing we need to do is generate the Github token.  Open Github.com and `login` with your username and password.

Once logged in, `Click` on your picture icon in the top left. Then go to `Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal Access Tokens`.

Here we want to generate a token, so `Click` on the `Generate a Token`. The token permissions need to be the `admin:repo_hook` which gives read and write access to the repository hooks.

Once the token is created, make sure to copy it down. We will need it later.

== Tekton Dashboard

Now we need to gain access to your tekton dashboard running in Openshift.

Open up a Terminal window and login to Openshift.

Once logged in run the following commands to find the tekton dashboard URL.

[source, bash]
----
oc get route -n kabanero
----

From there, look for the name `tekton-dashboard`. It should look something like

----
NAME               HOST/PORT                                                                                                          PATH      SERVICES           PORT      TERMINATION          WILDCARD
icpa-landing       ibm-cp-applications.*.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud                   icpa-landing       <all>     reencrypt/Redirect   None
kabanero-cli       kabanero-cli-kabanero.*.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud                 kabanero-cli       <all>     passthrough          None
kabanero-index     kabanero-collections.*.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud                  kabanero-index     <all>                          None
kabanero-landing   kabanero-landing-kabanero.*.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud           kabanero-landing   <all>     passthrough          None
tekton-dashboard   tekton-dashboard-kabanero.*.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud             tekton-dashboard   <all>     reencrypt/Redirect   None
----

We want to use the address that looks like `tekton-dashboard-kabanero.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud`. 

Next, open up a web browser and paste that into the address bar and hit `enter`.

Once on the dashboard, open up the `Secrets` tab that is found on the bottom left side of the screen.

image::tekton_dashboard_secrets.png[align="center"]

From there `Select` the `Add Secret` button on the right side of the screen.  

Next, we want to fill in the form with the following information:

----
Name: tekton-github
Namespace: kabanero
Access To: Git Server
Username: <yourusername>
Password: <Generated Token>
Service Account: kabanero-operator
Server URL: tekton.dev/git-0:https://github.com
----

Then `click` on `Submit` and your token is registered.
